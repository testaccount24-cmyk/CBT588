Receiving, Uploading and Installing the package

The package is distributed in TSO Transmit format (xmitip.xmit),
containing the installation partitioned data set.
The distribution file is compressed to a ZIP archive.

Having upload a copy of the distribution file on yor PC
perform the following  steps:

1. Unzip the file.

2. Read the late version of this document included with the
   distribution.

3. Connect to your OS/390 or z/OS system and upload the syscntl.xmit
   into a data set with RECFM=FB and LRECL=80 characteristics.
   Use BINARY file transfer mode.

4. Logon to your OS/390 or z/OS system and get into ISPF.

5. From ISPF option 6 enter RECEIVE INDS(upload.dsname) to expand
   the distribution file back into a partitioned data set.
   For the prompt enter the data set name you want the file restored to.
   This dataset is referred to as the Installation PDS
   (or just install.pds).

6. Then execute, again from ISPF option 6, the command:
   EX install.pds(RECEIVE)
   Follow the prompt to restore the various distribution libraries.

7. You will automatically be placed in browse on some of the members
   of the installation pds, including the $CHANGES member which
   contains the change history for this package.

8. Customize JCL proc and copy it to production PROCLIB.
   CHKTASK proc is used to execute SYSCNTL rexx exec.
   If you do not use CA DATACOM, remove that 6 steps and
   remove ddnames referring back to these steps from the last step

9. Copy members of LOAD library to production libraries.

 - Member IRX@MGCR from LOAD library must be MOVED
   to a library included into LINKLIST concatenation.
   Refresh LLA (F LLA,REFRESH) when done.
   It should not remain in a regular LOAD library.
   Include IRX@MGCR into the AUTHPGM list of authorised TSO programs
   in PARMLIB member IKJTSO00 and refresh TSO
   (enter at option 6 'PARMLIB UPDATE(00)').

 - IRXFLOC member of LOAD library must be copied to LINKLIB or a
   library used as STEPLIB. IRXFLOC package contains REXX functions.
   If you have IRXFLOC in your system, you might include
   the functions to your existing package. Use IRXFLOCJ
   member of ASM library as an example.
   IRXFLOC contains all function code. You do not need to copy
   separate functions (IRXF@xxx). They might be used for
   testing changes, if any.

   The following members must be copied to the same library as IRXFLOC:
   $OPEN  ALIAS($CLOSE,$OPENI,$OPENU,$OPENW,$READ,$WRITE)
   SVMALC6  ALIAS(SVMDEL6) SVM00000

   Other members in LOAD library are load modules you might need
   when link-editing the programs. Not required for execution.

10.Copy members from EXEC library to production SYSEXEC library.
   Members SHUTPROD, SHUTTEST, CHKPROD and CHKTEST are examples.
   You must customize these members for your environment.
   These members are being read and interpreted by the SYSCNTL exec
   and can/must use any subroutines and variables defined in SYSCNTL.
   They also can use the functions included into IRXFLOC or available
   in STEPLIB.

   Further customization of system shutdown and/or system check
   procedures might require changes in internal subroutines
   STOP and CHECK in SYSCNTL. See comments in SYSCNTL.
   For example, you need to update the names of CICS and database
   regions.

11. Security settings.
   CHKTASK proc (or whatever name you will choose) must be
   authorised started task in your system. A user ID must be assigned
   to this proc and it must be granted authority to issue
   any console commands and CICS modify commands.
   It must be authorized to execute SDSF batch commands to access
   SYSLOG (see SYSGETL exec comments for more details).
<<==========>>
HOW TO SETUP STARTED TASK TO HAVE CONSOLE AUTHORITY:
(names below are just an example, you may assign other names)
   1.  ASSIGN A USERID TO THE STARTED TASK, SETUP TSO SEGMENT TO USE
       IKJREADY PROC
   2.  CREATE A STARTED CLASS PROFILE FOR THE STARTED TASK, ASSIGN PROC
       NAME AS USERID AND STC AS GROUP.
   3.  GIVE READ ACCESS TO TSOAUTH CLASS, CONSOLE PROFILE
   4.  GIVE READ ACCESS TO THE TSOPROC CLASS IKJREADY PROFILE
   5.  IF THE STARTED TASK WILL BEING ISSUING STARTING STARTED TASK,
       GIVE UPDATE ACCESS TO STARTED TASK USERID.  IF THE STARTED TASK
       WILL BE ISSUING MODIFY COMMANDS, GIVE UPDATE ACCESS TO THE
       STARTED TASK USERID.  IF ISSUING ANY OTHER COMMANDS, OTHER
       PROFILES FOR MVS COMMANDS WILL NEED TO BE ADDED. (OPERCMDS CLASS)
       *NOTE - IF YOU ASSIGNED THE STARTED CLASS PROFILE TO STC FOR
               GROUP, THEN STC HAS ALREADY BEEN GIVEN UPDATE ACCESS FOR
               MODIFY AND START COMMANDS.
<<==========>>
TO SETUP A CONSOLE IN CICS FOR CHKTASK,
   THE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN DONE.
   1.  SETUP CN04 TERMINAL IN GROUP CONSUSER IN THE USERLIST LIST.
       THE CONSOLE NAME IS CHKTASK ASSIGNED TO USERID CHKTASK.
   2.  ADD CHKTASK USERID TO RACF AND PUT OWNER & DEFAULT GROUP TO STC.
       DO NOT ASSIGN A PASSWORD (UNDER ATTRIBUTES PUT YES IN THE
       NO-PASSWORD FIELD).  DOES NOT NEED A CICS SEGMENT.
   3.  ADD A STARTED RESOURCE CLASS PROFILE FOR CHKTASK.* ASSIGN STC AS
       OWNER AND USERID AS PROCNAME AND GROUP AS STC.
   4.  ADD CHKTASK USER TO THE APPL CLASS FOR PROFILES CICST390,
       CICSD390, CICSP390, AND CICSQ390 WITH AN ACCESS OF READ.
   5.  ADDED CHKTASK TO GCICSTRN CLASS, PROFILE SYSADM (WHICH CONTAINS
       OPERATIONS, SYSTEMS AND CICS RELATED USERS) WITH READ ACCESS.
       CHOSE THIS PROFILE SINCE IT CONTAINS THE *.CEMT RESOURCE WHICH
       IS THE TRANSACTION TO CHECK TASK RUNNING.
   6.  DO A REFRESH ON TCICSTRN CLASS FOR RACLIST (NOT A MISTAKE - THIS
       CLASS AND GCICSTRN WORK TOGETHER.)
   7.  THIS STARTED TASK WILL BE ABLE TO ISSUE MODIFY AND START COMMANDS
       SINCE ALL STARTED TASKS HAVE THIS AUTHORITY.

SDSF security setting example:
               To set a proper authorisation you might need a
               ISFPRM00 member in system PARMLIB.
               It must define a user group that has authority
               to use SDSF in batch, for example:
                  GROUP NAME(ISFBATC2),    /* define group       */
                  ILPROC(BATCH),           /* NTBL name          */
                  IUID(SYSPRGS),           /* NTBL name          */
                  AUTH(I,O,H,DA,ST,SE,PREF,LOG), /* funct allowed*/
                  CMDLEV(2),               /* command level      */
                  OWNER(USERID)            /* deafult owner      */

               and definition for included logon procedures:
                  NTBL NAME(SYSPRGS)
                    NTBLENT STRING(CHKTASK),OFFSET(1)
                    ... other sysprogs ...
                  NTBL NAME(BATCH)         /* referred by GROUP  */
                    NTBLENT STRING(AFD)    /* for PGM=ISFAFD     */
                    NTBLENT STRING(BATCH)  /* for PGM=SDSF       */
       Having modified ISFPRM00 issue F SDSF,REFRESH
