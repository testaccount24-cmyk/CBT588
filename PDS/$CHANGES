File Change History

08/06/2003 Removed site-specific data. Changed SHUTTEST and SHUTPROD
         to shut JES2 with flexible wait for VTAM stop.

07/22/2003 Modified REXX functions L_ALC/FRE, L_DDN, L_DSN,
         L_PDS and L_PGM (that use IRXSAY for error messages)
         to check if address of IRXSAY is 0 and use WTP in this case.
         (e.g. when executing under CA OPS).
         Minor changes in some REXX execs.

06/17/2003 Modified SVM0033 to avoid opening dataset if
         RACF access is 'No'. SVM0033 is called by L_DDN, L_DSN.
         Updated PWD exec to strip records for printing.
         Updated proc CHKTASK - now it can be executed
         in MSTR subsystem and shut JES2 down.
         Modified SYSACTV and SYSGETL execs to make them more reliable.

06/06/2003 Added check for TCPIP to CHKTEST, CHKPROD and SYSCNTL execs.
         Added execs that use ISPF environment under IKJEFT1B:
         - # - sets ISPF batch envir and calls user's exec (ISPSTART).
         - DSNSTAT - returns dsn statistics for vol or dsn prefix.
         - PDSSTAT - returns members statistics (uses MATCH function
           from REXXTOOL to process member name wildcard).
         Sample use:
         //STEP1   EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1B,DYNAMNBR=99,
         //  PARM='%# %PW'
         //.....

05/23/2003 Removed L_CND because CONVDATE has errors,
         rexx function DATE() can do better almost everything.
         L_DSN now returns SYSDSNAME of GDG(+1) (with dataset not
         found), so you can allocate the new dataset with TSO ALLOC.

05/21/2003 Added support for VIO and GDG to L_DDN, L_DSN.
         Added support for existing GDG datasets to L_ALC, L_FRE.

05/04/2003 fixed non-REENT bugs in IRXF@FWT, IRXF@WTO.
         Added 4-digit UCB address to IRXF#DDN and IRXF@DSN.
         Replaced FWAIT by reentrant IRXF@FWT. It has two function
         names: FWAIT and L_FWT for compatibility.

04/28/2003 added L_CND (REXX function invokes CONVDATE
         from CBT file 216). CONVDATE RC changed to indicate
         invalid parameter.
         Added L_PGM - program mapper function.
         Updated IRXFLOC and $IRXFLOC (doc).
         Fixed minor bug in functions that Say error messages:
         L_ALC, L_CND, L_DDN, L_DSN, L_PDS, L_PGM.

03/14/2003 added $SYSCNTL, $IRXFLOC docs.
         Updated comments in hlq.EXEC(SHUTPROD) and *(SHUTTEST)

03/13/2003 fixed SVMALC6 - reenterability error

03/11/2003 fixed L_ALC, L_FRE and SVMALC programs,
         Fixed L_PDS for bigger PDS,
         updated IRXFLOC.
         Minor improvements in PWI, DCPY and PWR.

03/07/2003 added IRXF@SRT (L_SORT) REXX function
         from CBT file 386, rewritten as reentrant
         Fixed corruption in IRXF#ALC
         Updated CHKTASK LCL proc
         Updated $DOC and $INSTALL

02/20/2003 created to automate system shutdown
         and control system tasks for OS/390 v2r10
